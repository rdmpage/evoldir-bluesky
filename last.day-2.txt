Fully-funded PhD scholarship to study the extended genome of
freeze-tolerant alpine insects in New Zealand

Many different alpine insects in Aotearoa/New Zealand have converged
on the same unusual evolutionary strategy for surviving the cold; they
freeze solid and survive. Eating the right microbes can change how and
when insects freeze, potentially providing benefits that are shared by
unrelated host species. Alternatively this insects may have independently
converged on similar species-specific solution for ice nucleation.

Review paper here: https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/14/1/89

You should have a background in molecular evolution and some programming
experience would be an advantage. You will focus on bioinformatics to
investigate the type and sources of ice nucleating agents that enable
survival of freezing. You will generate DNA and RNA from sympatric insect
taxa to compare ice+ activity of hosts and their microbiomes.

The scholarship: A tax-free living allowance stipend of NZ$35,000 per
annum for 3 years, plus tuition fees paid for 3 years. Advert here:
https://www.massey.ac.nz/study/scholarships-and-awards/phd-scholarship-freeze-tolerant-insects-and-the-microbiome/

Start date: March 2025 or soon after.

Location: The successful applicant will be based on the Manawat� campus
of Massey University, Palmerston North, NEW ZEALAND. Massey University
is a smoke-free work environment.

Lead researchers are Mary Morgan-Richards and Steve Trewick of the Te
Taha Tawhiti research group: https://evolves.massey.ac.nz is within the
Wildlife & Ecology Group.

Admission criteria & candidate requirements: You'll need a good first
degree from an internationally recognised university; minimum upper
second class Hons or a Master's degree in an appropriate subject.
You should have a background in Ecology/Biology/Evolution/Entomology,
good statistics skills (preferably experience with R) and an interest
in evolution and microbiomes.

How to Apply:
In the first instance we encourage you to contact us by email to discuss

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION in coevolution - the University of Helsinki

The Insect Symbiosis Ecology and Evolution (ISEE) Research Group at the
Organismal and Evolutionary Research Program, the University of Helsinki,
Finland invites applications for a

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER

in Microbiota Manipulation for Pathogen Control in Pollinators

Symbiotic bacterial communities can play an important role for
the health and evolution of the hosts that they associated with. Many
insects harbor beneficial gut microbiotas involved in resistance against
disease. Furthermore, both biotic and abiotic factors can influence the
bond between hosts and their associated microbes, and create an imbalance
that may be linked to a decrease in the fitness of the host organism,
and their population dynamics. This comprehensive project focuses
on how resilient bacterial communities associated with bumblebees
are to pathogen infections. The selected candidate (postdoc level)
will test the effect of pathogens on the species composition of the
microbiota of bumblebees in the laboratory, and test for the beneficial
effects of diverse bacterial species in maintaining microbiota and host
health. Tasks will include insect rearing in laboratory conditions,
molecular work, microbiota analyses,and writing of manuscripts.The
specific details of the project will be adjusted to fit the research
interests of both the PI and the postdoc.

https://jobs.helsinki.fi/job/Helsinki-Postdoctoral-Researcher-in-Microbiota-Manipulation-for-Pathogen-Control-in-Pollinators/808615502/
For this position,experience with conducting experimental
assays with animals and in completing analyses of meta-barcoding or
metagenomic data is required. Additional skills in analyses of RNAseq data
and behavioral data, and in conducting outreach are meriting but not
strictly mandatory. Candidates with degrees in Evolutionary Biology,
Molecular Biology, Microbiology or similar, with experience in the
above-mentioned research area are strongly encouraged to apply.

The position is available in the ISEE research group of Dr. Anne
DUPLOUY, starting as soon as possible, but no later than June 2024. The
ISEE research group is part of the Organismal and Evolutionary Biology
research program (OEB) within the Faculty of Biological and Environmental
Sciences in the Viikki Science park. The faculty hosts over 40 leading
research groups in Plant and Animal Ecology, Evolutionary Genetics,
among others. This community interacts on a regular basis through
seminars. The University of Helsinki provides office space, computers,
bench in a State-of-the-art molecular laboratory, as well as data
storage space with regular automatic backups. The campus offers various
key facilities, including green houses and climate chambers for insect
and plant rearing, laboratories furnished with state-of-the-art molecular
equipment, genome sequencing and microscopy facilities. Computational
resources from CSC are available. The project is in collaboration with
Prof Johan EKROOS from the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry at the
University of Helsinki. International collaborations with colleagues
from Montpellier, Graz and Warwick Universities are possible within the
scope of the project.

   research group, and ambitions (eg. How do you fit?, what would you
   bring?, what do you seek?)(max. 1 page)
2) Curriculum Vitae
3) List of publications (preprints can be mentioned, if a doi is
   also provided)
4) Names and contact details of two references

********************Conferences********************

An SMBE satellite meeting entitled "The Origin, Maintenance and Evolution
of Biological Noise" will take place in T�bingen, Germany, June 3 - 5, 2025.

Details can be found here:
https://pallareslab.github.io/bionoise2025/index.html

Noise is a fundamental, yet long understudied, aspect of biology. The goal
of this symposium is to bring together researchers working on noise from
different fields (e.g., theoreticians, molecular biologists, population
geneticists, system biologists, philosophers) in order to establish the
common principles guiding the origin, maintenance, and evolution of
biological noise at distinct organization levels, from molecules, to
transcriptional networks, to higher-order phenotypes, to populations.

After a plenary talk by the philosopher of science Francesca Merlin, we
plan four sessions, each with an invited keynote talk, contributed talks,
posters and discussion. There will be no concurrent events at this meeting.

1. Non-genetic inheritance of phenotypic noise (keynote: Maria
   Carmo-Fonseca)
2. The genetic basis of phenotypic noise (keynote: TBD)
3. The organismal implications of phenotypic noise (keynote:
   Patricia Wittkopp)
4. The population genetics of phenotypic noise (keynote: Daniel
   Weinreich)

Abstracts are due February 28, 2025, and acceptance decisions will be made
March 15, 2025. Please note that the meeting is capped at 40, meaning that
it may not be possible to accept all applications. Acceptance decisions
will seek to maximize intellectual diversity as well as the diversity of
participants. Special attention will be paid to individuals from
historically underrepresented groups, as well as to early career
investigators. Stipends may be available in cases of need.

Details can be found here:
https://pallareslab.github.io/bionoise2025/index.html

Please feel free to forward this message to interested individuals in your
research group and wider community.
