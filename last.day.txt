Open PhD student position at the Department of Aquatic Microbial Ecology,
Institute of Hydrobiology, Biology Centre CAS, ÃeskÃ© BudÃ¬jovice,
Czech Republic

A PhD position is open to study viruses of protists, with an emphasis on
Giant Viruses and Polinton-like viruses, using high-throughput isolation
methods, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and experimental
approaches.

Protists are susceptible to infection by viruses just like all cellular
life forms. However, little is known about their defense systems.
Polinton-like viruses (PLVs) exist both as transposon-like elements
in protist genomes and as bona fide DNA viruses that parasitize
protist-infecting Giant Viruses (GVs), limiting their spread and
safeguarding protist populations. Despite their remarkable abundance
in some aquatic environments and expansions in certain protists, how
PLVs infect cells, interact with the GV replication machinery, and the
conditions under which they might reactivate from their host's genome
remains obscure. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose to combine
state-of-the-art genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to track
individual infection stages in model protist-GV-PLVs systems. To achieve
this, we will first isolate freshwater protists and subsequently their
GVs and PLVs. The anticipated outcomes will enhance our understanding of
antiviral defense systems in microeukaryotes and microbial interactions
at large.

********************WorkshopsCourses********************

The 2025 Workshop on Molecular Evolution at the Marine Biological
Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA will be held May 22 to June 1, 2025.

Founded in 1988, the Workshop on Molecular Evolution is the
longest-running workshop of its kind. The Workshop is the premier
program for integrating the methods, theory, and applications of
molecular phylogenetics, statistical genetics, molecular evolution,
and related disciplines. Students work closely with internationally
recognized scientists, receiving (i) high-level instruction in the
principles of molecular evolution and phylogenetics; (ii) advanced
training in statistical methods best suited to modern datasets and
biological questions concerning species, populations, or infectious
diseases; and (iii) hands-on experience with the latest software tools
(often from the authors of the programs they are using). The material
is delivered via lectures, discussions, and bioinformatic exercises
motivated by contemporary topics in molecular evolution. Recently added
topics to the course include deep-time phylogenomics, phylodynamics,
and comparative methods.

A hallmark of this workshop is the direct interaction between students
and field-leading scientists. The workshop serves graduate students,
postdocs, and established faculty from around the world seeking to apply
the principles of molecular evolution to questions of both basic and
applied biological sciences. A priority of this workshop is to foster
an environment where students can learn from each other as well from
the course faculty. As the course progresses, participants learn how to
use the following software and tools to address questions concerning the
origins, maintenance, and function of molecular variation: ASTRAL, BEST,
FASTA, IQ-TREE, MIGRATE, MAFFT, MP-EST, Open Tree, RAxML, RevBayes, PAML,
PAUP*, SNaQ, and SVD Quartets. Students will have the opportunity to work
with software on their own laptops as well as receive training on how
to use the same programs on a computer cluster. In 2025, the confirmed
course instructors include Peter Beerli, Joseph Bielawski, Jeremy Brown,
Belinda Chang, Scott Edwards, Laura Eme, Mandev Gill, Tracy Heath, John
Huelsenbeck, Sungsik Kong, Lacey Knowles, Laura Kubatko, Paul Lewis,
Emily Jane McTavish, Claudia Solis-Lemus, David Swofford, Anne Yoder,
and Rosana Zenil-Ferguson.

Deadline for applications is January 29, 2025:
