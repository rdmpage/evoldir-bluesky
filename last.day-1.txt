PhD position: Population genetics of free-roaming dogs and disease

A funded PhD position is available in the group of Gerald Heckel
for genomic research on the population structure and connectivity of
free-roaming dogs and their viruses. This position is part of a large
interdisciplinary project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation
(SNSF) aiming to determinethe role of free-roaming dogs in the spread and
persistence of infectious disease. The project will combine experts from
veterinary and social sciences, epidemiology, mathematical modelling and
population genetics to test which influence the landscape, infrastructure
and human-dog relationships have on disease transmission in Africa and
Asia. A postdoctoral position will open soon to work closely with the
PhD candidate on the population genetics aspects, and several PhD and
postdoctoral researchers from the other disciplines will collaborate. The
overarching goal of the project is to formulate effective and socially
accepted control strategies to reduce infection and disease burden in
dogs and humans.

I am looking for a skilled, reliable and highly-motivated PhD candidate
who is able to work independently and in a diverse team of different
origins and educational backgrounds. The project includes periods of data
collection on free-roaming dogs in Uganda, Chad, Indonesia, and India
together with local and international collaborators. Experience with
fieldwork in potentially physically challenging conditions is a plus. You
must have a solid background in evolutionary biology, and some practical
experience with bioinformatics, population genetics or evolutionary
genomics. Experience with molecular laboratory work or fieldwork is
advantageous but not essential. Most of your time will be devoted to
the processing and analysis of genomic data sets, and the preparation
of presentations and manuscripts. A Master degree in a relevant field
is required. Obtaining a PhD from the University of Bern will require
the writing of several manuscripts for leading scientific journals.

The position is fully funded for up to four years with an anticipated
starting date of June 2025. My group is part of the Institute of Ecology
and Evolution with a stimulating, multi-national research community
and excellent infrastructure. English is the working language. Some
knowledge of German or French is beneficial for living in Switzerland
but it is not essential for the PhD project. The city of Bern and the
region is a fabulous place to live.

Please send your application as a single (!!!) pdf file to
Prof. Dr. Gerald Heckel gerald.heckel@unibe.ch.

To be considered, the pdf must include a letter describing your particular
skills and motivation for the project and which past research experience
makes you a suitable candidate (max. 2 pages), the abstract of your
Master thesis, a CV, and contact details of 2-3 referees. Review of
applications will begin February 32025.

Research Scientist (Metagenomics)

Applications are invited for a Research Scientist to join the Laboratory
of Dr Hildebrand in the Gut Microbes and Health programme at Quadram
Institute Bioscience (QIB), based in Norwich, UK.

Background:

Join an ERC funded research project investigating the inheritance and
evolution of human associated microbes. The project will be conducted
in a multidisciplinary team at the Quadram & Earlham Institutes, UK,
and combine newly established patient cohorts, concomitantly developed
wetlab and bioinformatics protocols that enable a unique perspective
into microbiomes.

The role:

How do gut bacteria colonize their human hosts and families? How do
they then persist for decades in the same host? And how do they evolve
and adapt to their unique human host? How do we investigate bacteria
with specialized metabolism in microbiomes? The aim for this post is to
dissect the microbial genetics enabling human long-term colonization on
a novel family centric cohort established in the UK.

High-resolution metagenomics will be used to track microbes -
eukaryotic and prokaryotic -  across individuals and in families, and
determine genes under selection. This will include closely working with
metagenomic bioinformatics (assembly, genome binning, gene predictions)
and combining this with population genetics and/or network inference
algorithms. Thus, exploring microbiomes at unprecedented resolution can
resolve eco-evolutionary processes determining resilience and functional
plasticity of natural microbiomes.

The environment:

The Hildebrand group (https://falk.science) uses metagenomics to research
the diversity, community interactions, and evolution of microbes in
communities using custom software solutions. The group has a joint
appointment between the Quadram Institute Bioscience and Earlham Institute
to bridge data and life science, developing software such as LotuS2 and
MATAFILER and pushing the limits of high-resolution metagenomics.

The Norwich Research Park (NRP) UK, hosts 4 BBSRC Institute, > 15
companies, 3,000 researchers and clinicians, 17,000 students. The
Quadram Institute is a new interdisciplinary research institute
dedicated to understanding how food and microbes interact to promote
health and prevent disease. Its mission is to deliver healthier lives
through innovation in gut health, microbiology and food. A partnership
between Quadram Institute Bioscience, the University of East Anglia, the
Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and BBSRC, it brings together
scientists and clinicians in a state-of-the-art building on the NRP,
being one Europe's largest centres for microbiology and life sciences
(https://quadram.ac.uk/).

Norwich ranked in the top 10 for UK cities with a beautiful, historical
town centre and an active gastropub & coffee aficionado scene.

The ideal candidate:

bioinformatics, computer science or a related discipline with a background
and/or interest in at least one of the following subjects:

- Microbiomes & biodiversity
- Metagenomics & patient cohorts
- Ecology & evolution

The ideal candidate will have experience in conducting scientific
experiments independently, writing papers, presenting work and grant
writing. Basic statistics and programming skills (either R, python, Perl,
C++, or equivalent) is essential. Specialized skills will be taught and
developed through mentorship and collaborations.

Additional information:

Salary on appointment will be within the range �36,720 to �44,000 per
annum depending on qualifications and experience. This is a full-time
post for a contract of 24 months.
